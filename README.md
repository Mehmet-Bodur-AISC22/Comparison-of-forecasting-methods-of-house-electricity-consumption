# House Electric Energy Consumption Forecasting
We used three different well developed models for forecasting (BRNN, SVR, Fuzzy SBC)  and tested them in three different time terms (Very Short, Short, Medium) and compared them to reveal their weaknesses and strengths in different time terms. Additionally, their processing time are measured. Honda Smart Home US dataset chose as a case study for this work.
